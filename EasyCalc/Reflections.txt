Possible Improvements:
* Make it possible to use Sin(), Cos(), Tan(), Pi, E, and more in the calculator.
* Fix the problem with filtering user input.
* Overall improvment in code structure and readability.
* Code optimization.

This calculator is not perfect and there is lots of possible improvements that could be made.

There exists another version of this calculator that could not be finished in time that hopefully 
will implement all of the above mentioned improvements eventually. As well as having a much cooler design.
